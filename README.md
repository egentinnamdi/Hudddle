## About Me
Hi, my name is Nnamdi James. Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer with a strong interest in building  user friendly interfaces and robust backend systems. when Mr Tochi told me a bit about the idea of what Hudddle was all about. I knew it was something i would like to be part of. I  have about 2 years experience working as a web developer and i'm always up to date with any trend or development going on in the field. 

## Project Overview
This project is a front-end implementation of a design shared via Figma for the Huddlde technical assessment. It focuses on responsiveness, and also implementation of some functionalities like being able to create and monitor an order. Functionality like being able to login and monitor a user session was not implemented just to keep things a bit simple. I ensured I followed industry standard and clean code practices while working on this assessment for easy code maintainability and readability by any other developer who goes through the code.
